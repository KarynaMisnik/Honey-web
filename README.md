## Honey&Products

A web shop for an imaginary family business, where you can learn more about a couple of farmers who produce honey, cosmetics, and food products based on honey.

## Overview

A good example of building a simple shopping cart, demonstrating the concept of routing, the usage of the map method, and employing a JSON file as an API for a project that involves a massive amount of images. Additionally, it serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to utilizing pre-built components from the Material-UI (MUI) library.
